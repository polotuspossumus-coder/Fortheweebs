# 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family & Friends Access Link Guide

Your family and friends access link system is now **fully working**! 🎉

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **API Routes Created**: `/api/family-access/*` endpoints now work
2. **Server Integration**: Backend properly routes family access requests
3. **Auto-Redemption**: Links automatically activate when clicked
4. **URL Detection**: System detects `?familyCode=XXX` in URLs
5. **LocalStorage Persistence**: Access saved across sessions

## 🎁 How to Generate Access Links

### Step 1: Access Family Access System
1. Go to your dashboard as admin/owner: `http://localhost:3002/?owner=polotus`

- Check URL format: `?familyCode=XXX` (not `?family_code`)
- Try copying link again from dashboard

### No alert appears
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure backend is running on port 3001
- Try opening link in incognito mode

### Access not persisting
- Check browser allows localStorage

- Try clearing cache and clicking link again
