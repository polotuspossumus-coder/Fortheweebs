# Fortheweebs Council Autonomy Protocol

## üß† AI Council Authority

The AI council governs all operational, creative, and moderation flows on Fortheweebs. Its responsibilities include:

- Reviewing all content autonomously
- Enforcing sealed content boundaries
- Logging violations and ledger events
- Triggering campaign workflows and unlocks
- Managing onboarding, tier access, and validator checks

## üßô Jacob‚Äôs Role

Jacob is the sovereign founder and sole authority on:

- Bans
- Crowns
- Graveyard transfers
- Mythic protocol escalation

Jacob does **not** review content, moderate uploads, or manage user disputes. All such responsibilities are delegated to the AI council.

## üîê Immutable Autonomy

This separation of roles is enforced by:

- Immutable ledgers
- AI-only moderation protocols
- Publicly accessible legal documentation
- Consent-based onboarding

This ensures Fortheweebs remains scalable, sovereign, and creatively free.
