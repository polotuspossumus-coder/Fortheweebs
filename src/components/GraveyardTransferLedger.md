# Fortheweebs Graveyard Transfer Protocol

When a creator is banned:

- Their content is monetized for the platform
- Ownership is transferred to Fortheweebs
- A ledger entry is created with timestamp, reason, and initiator
- Jacob is the sole authority on bans
- AI council enforces sealed content boundaries and flags violations

This protocol ensures integrity, justice, and legacy preservation.
